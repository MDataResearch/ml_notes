Supervised Learning:
In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an 
input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value 
(also called thesupervisory signal).

Regression:
Use data samples to estimating the relationships between a dependent 
variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more 
independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').

Unsupervised Learning:
Draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without 
labeled responses.
